It's been a while. Let's take a step back with a refresher...

You’ve entered occupied territory. For your own reasons, you have chosen to travel to Merridale Falls, which is the chief market town of Morndale.

The journey there was mostly uneventful. War has ravaged the land, and those farmsteads that weren’t burnt to the ground were abandoned and left for nature to reclaim.
A few patrols, easily avoided, were encountered on the way.

After four days of walking, you started to see signs of habitation - smoke from cooking fires, the distant lowing of sheep, and an occasional whistle of a shepherd calling his dog.

Crossing through the tumbled fells of the Thornwych Hills you rounded a bend in the road and came upon an ambush in progress.

Arrows were loosed, spells were cast and shields were shattered.
You were hard pressed, but were still close to victory, when a group of riders arrived, led by a charismatic and ruggedly handsome warrior (who looked a bit like me apparently). They dispatched the hobgoblin ambushers in short order.

Rendil Morn, leader of the riders and Clan Lord of Morndale, gave you a task to rid his people of a curse - a disease that sends people to sleep, eventually causing them to waste away and die.

He advised you to reach the town before nightfall as the disease strikes after dark. Rumours abound of dark shadows that prowl the streets - locals call them the Night Shades.

You watched as the riders left with the wagons and the dead hobgoblins started to attract flies. You stripped the corpses of anything worth keeping and found a curious amulet. It was embossed with the symbol of a dragon, matching the blaze on the shields of the hobgoblins.

Returning to the road, you found a young half-orc clearing the signs of the ambush. A tense moment ensued before Corvis the Ranger recognised the newcomer as Thuramarsh, an acquaintance he had met over a meal of venison, some time ago.
