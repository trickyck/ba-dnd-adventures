Thuramarsh took the amulet and, to the astonishment of everyone, hurled it far down into the ravine below. He turned back and said:

>“You hold the amulet, they find you.”

A tense way to begin a reunion.

Mindful of Morn’s advice, you made haste and headed to the township. The road wound down from the hills to the wooded valley below.
A small stream (known in the local parlance as a ‘beck’) crossed the path and cascaded down a rocky gully.

An old woman was kneeling by the stream in the shade of a thorn tree, washing some clothes by hand. 
She had an eerie feel about her (some might say creepy).
