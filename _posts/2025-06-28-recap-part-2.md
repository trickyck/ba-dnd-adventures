Thuramarsh took the amulet and, to the astonishment of everyone, hurled it far down into the ravine below. He turned back and said:

>“You hold the amulet, they find you.”

A tense way to begin a reunion.

Mindful of Morn’s advice, you made haste and headed to the township. The road wound down from the hills to the wooded valley below.
A small stream (known in the local parlance as a ‘beck’) crossed the path and cascaded down a rocky gully.

An old woman was kneeling by the stream in the shade of a thorn tree, washing some clothes by hand. 
She had an eerie feel about her (some might say creepy).

She answered your questions in riddles and rhymes. Then vanished into the shadows with one final warning whispered on the wind…

  <blockquote>
<p>A pact is struck - as old as Time,</p>
<p>The gift of knowledge is ne’er free,</p>
<p>So answer me my questions three</p>
<p> Once the morning bell doth chime</p>
<p>Answer thee with honest breath</p>
<p>Or pay the price - truth or death.</p>
</blockquote>
