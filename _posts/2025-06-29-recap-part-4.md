The taproom in the Red Rock was half empty, despite it being Market Day the following morning. 

The warm glow of the fireplace attracted Rover immediately.

The rest of you followed him and settled at a table nearby as the cat curled up on the floor, content to stay there for the night.

Sariel scanned the room, looking for things to steal - old habits die hard. Thuramarsh followed her gaze and leant across the table, whispering:

>"Don't even think it. You attract the guards, we're all dead."

Pity, there was a very ornate sword hanging above the bar.

Conversation around the room seemed to be mostly about the next morning's market, but occasionally, the words "Night Shade" could be heard. You could taste the unease in the air. A hand waved a leather belt in your faces. Looking down, you saw a young halfling waving the belt, eagerly proclaiming:

<blockquote> "Look at the workmanship on it! Such a fine belt you've never seen. The tanner downstream, can't remember his name, 'Dullard' or summat like that - such a craftsman." </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Have you heard about these Night Shade things?" he asked brightly. The room went silent. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"I saw one yester-eve, black as midnight and as big as a house it was!' he said, stretching his arms wide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Everything looks as big as a house to you Kendo." A young lady halfling stood nearby, a wry smile on her face. "And if it was anything, it was just a shadow. Or maybe a ghost, if you want to get all spooky about it."</blockquote>

Another voice chimed in. A burly man with a butcher's apron on said:
>"Ghosts of the Dwarves they are, coming to take revenge." 

He eyed Perris up to make sure she wasn't see-through.

The halfling bent low and said: 

<blockquote>"Kendo Underhill, at your service. The young lass scowling at me is my bride-to-be, the Lady Torrentine of Gryphonstone Crossing. Pay no mind to her, she wasn't there when I saw it. And weren't no ghost neither, least not like any I've seen before."</blockquote>

Torrentine muttered to herself, but loud enough for others to hear: 
>"That's because you ain't see any ghosts before."

<blockquote>"I don't believe there's been a dwarf in these parts for many a year," Kendo continued, pretending not to have heard. "At least that what I have heard. I'm a bard you see and I collect stories."</blockquote>

The butcher, still eyeing Perris suspiciously, said 
>"Not surprising, since half the town is laying in the temple with the Dream Fever. No one comes here unless they have to."

A large man stepped out of the kitchen and called out:
>"Sun's a-setting good folks. Time to be home indoors. My brother Kamiran is about to lock up, so sup up now and be on yer way. Keep to the light and don't tarry. Watch the shadows."
