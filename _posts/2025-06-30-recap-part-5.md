The shutters were closed and barred, and the doors were boarded up. 

Kamiran kin Margen, one of the tavern’s owners, kept a silent vigil by the fireside while the guests filed out of the common room. The Red Rock Tavern was locked up for the night.

Corvis, Perris, Thuramarsh and Samira climbed the stairs to their rooms while Rover and Sariel chose to stay downstairs. Rover curled up by the fireside, occasionally twitching in his sleep. Sariel fell into her trance-like state, a legacy of her Elvish heritage.

The room fell quiet as the night settled in…

… and then the howling began.

The sound seemed to come from all directions, echoing off the high buildings and town walls. Wolves? Wargs? Werewolves perhaps? No one was keen to venture outside to investigate … without any weapons. You had stashed them in a safe place outside of the town to avoid a confrontation with the guards. Now you were feeling more vulnerable than ever.

A turbulent night for everyone. The howling was maddening enough, but each of you had troubling dreams as well - tossing and turning and then suddenly starting awake.

Booted footsteps could be heard outside in the market square. Guards patrolling, with torches blazing brightly. No one else could be seen in the streets… and the howling went on.

Dawn came, silently. No roosters cried or dogs barked. But the village came to life as shutters were opened and people pushed their handcarts filled with wares to the market square.
