And here we go...

The market square outside of the tavern was already busy with farmers and merchants setting up stalls and gossiping. 

Rover and Sariel greeted their companions as the rest of the party came downstairs. Where was Corvis though? The Ranger didn’t respond to Perris’ thumping on the door and everyone assumed he was sleeping in.
 
Taking stock of the learnings from the previous night, you decided you had a few options. First and foremost was to retrieve your weapons and stash them in the rooms. After that, thetre would be time to explore the town and visit the temple where the afflicted were being cared for.
The trick was how to get your weapons past the guards. Samira suggested they use a culvert in the south wall. Blank stares all round. “What’s a ‘culvert’?” Thuramarsh asked.
 
Samira has grown up in this town after leaving religious order at the Temple of Ariella at the waterfall upstream. Her local knowledge could prove invaluable, so long as she uses words that everyone understands.
 
“There’s a small drainage tunnel cut through the south wall on River Street. I used to use it to leave the town unnoticed.”
 
Thuramarsh looked at the gnome. “Will I fit?” he asked.
 
“If you suck that gut in, maybe.” she replied.
 
Heading off across the market square, you wound your way through the back streets that sloped gently down to River Street. As you drew closer, Samira stopped suddenly and stood very still. There before you was a two-storey townhouse with a sign swaying in the wind. “The Cobbler” it proclaimed.

This was Samira’s home.
 
She needed to go inside. Her adopted parent and mentor, Kez, needed to know she was back, and she should be the one to tell him. But the front door was locked and the windows were shuttered. No sounds came from inside the house and so she tried the rear door. Also locked. Picking it was no great issue and she was careful to avoid the trap that Kez usually set. He was a master of tricks like that, so Samira was careful. Odd, it wasn’t trapped - something was wrong.
 
Quickly slipping inside, and joined by her fellow thief Sariel, the pair went from room to room looking for signs of life. The place was empty. The fireplace was cold and didn’t look like it had been lit for several days. Searching through her old bedroom, Samira came across a small box – stashed in her favourite hiding place. Kez had left it for her to find.
 
Inside the box was a note and a small brooch.
 
Samira quietly read through the note, a tear in her eye. She stopped and began to sob quietly.

Sariel looked on, concerned but not willing to intrude on her friend’s grief.
 
“We should go, the others are waiting outside and the sun is rising.”
 
“Yes” Samira replied, “But we can stay here when we get the weapons. Kez is not coming back and I need to search the house for something.”
