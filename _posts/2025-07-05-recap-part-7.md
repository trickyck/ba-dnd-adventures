Once upon a time....

Samira had grown up in Merridale Falls in the care of Kez Thal'Madrin the cobbler - a gentle and kind old elf.

His surname means 'goat herder' in elvish which always struck Samira as odd, and suggested it was a false name. His past was something that he tried to keep hidden, even from Samira, but she had her suspicions.

The cobbler's shop faced on to River Street along the southern wall of the town. River Street was the poor section and was where the beggars tended to gather.

Kez was always generous towards them, sparing a coin or a crust of bread whenever he could. He used to say to Samira: 

>"Be kind to them, they know things."

And now, it seems, he was gone.

With Sariel alongside her, Samira rejoined her companions. She pointed down the street about 30 yards. There was a shallow drain that crossed the road and went under the wall. Odd. There were no guards manning the wall.

Thuramarsh sized up the culvert judging whether he could fit through it. With Samira's stinging rebuke in his ears, he sucked his gut in and tried. Thankfully it was wider on the other side.

One by one, you passed through and stood in the shadows of the wall. Still no guards in sight. A quick splash across the river and into the cover of the forest on the other side, and you were on your way.

You made your way back to the site where you cached your weapons, checking for signs of tampering. Nothing. Looking good so far. You grabbed everything, including Corvis' bow and sword and headed back. Noise from the town market could be heard as you passed through the woodlands to the culvert. Still no guards along the southern walls.

Emerging from the culvert, you found a group of beggars, squatting in the shadow of the wall a hundred yards away, beyond the Cobbler's house. Chasing them off, you quickly ducked into Kez's house. Storing the weapons safely, you needed to head back to the Red Rock to find Corvis and let him know what was happening. 

<blockquote>Let's hope he's awake by now.</blockquote>
