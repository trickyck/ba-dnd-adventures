The taproom in the Red Rock was half empty, despite it being Market Day the following morning. 

The warm glow of the fireplace attracted Rover immediately.

The rest of you followed him and settled at a table nearby as the cat curled up on the floor, content to stay there for the night.

Sariel scanned the room, looking for things to steal - old habits die hard. Thuramarsh followed her gaze and leant across the table, whispering:

>"Don't even think it. You attract the guards, we're all dead."

Pity, there was a very ornate sword hanging above the bar.

Conversation around the room seemed to be mostly about the next morning's market, but occasionally, the words "Night Shade" could be heard. You could taste the unease in the air. A hand waved a leather belt in your faces. Looking down, you saw a young halfling waving the belt, eagerly proclaiming:

<blockquote> "Look at the workmanship on it! Such a fine belt you've never seen. The tanner downstream, can't remember his name, 'Dullard' or summat like that - such a craftsman." </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Have you heard about these Night Shade things?" he asked brightly. The room went silent. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"I saw one yester-eve, black as midnight and as big as a house it was!' he said, stretching his arms wide.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Everything looks as big as a house to you Kendo." A young lady halfling stood nearby, a wry smile on her face. "And if it was anything, it was just a shadow. Or maybe a ghost, if you want to get all spooky about it."</blockquote>

Another voice chimed in. A burly man with a butcher's apron on said:
>"Ghosts of the Dwarves they are, coming to take revenge." 

He eyed Perris up to make sure she wasn't see-through.
